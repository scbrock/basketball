# basketball - NBA Team Stat Predictor

file: NBA_data_exploration_2.ipynb

## Purpose:
Perform exploratory data analysis and make predictions on NBA team and/or player stats. 

## Data:
All the data used has been taken from nba.com. Data has been divided into two groups, team and player. Team data represents team averages for a given season. Player data represents player averages for a given season. Feature vectors are then generated based on a team's most recent season performance. For training and testing, the labels are the categorized team statistics (e.g. pts, 3pt %, win %, etc.) for the following year. 

## Implementation:
I use a Jupyter notebook to work with the data, perform exploratory analysis, engineer features, and evaluate models. 

## Results:
There are certain stats that can be predicted such as a player's season field goal percentage given last season's stats for that player.
